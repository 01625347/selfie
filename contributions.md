# Diff. monster / littlemonster

## aliases error

In `void getSymbol()`:
Because of the restriction that each condition should restrain only the last assignment.

## abstract operators
+ implementation of modular stride intervals
`adding step and restrictions`

+ restrictions being for:
  - `soundness`, control the overflows of the abstract representation domain.
  - `completeness`, is there an over-approximation (impossible concrete values)

+ add and sub with modular stride intervals
  `gcd function`

+ warnings when over-approximations are done
  `printOverApprox();`

## tainted analysis

 + flag `-t`: count symbolic operations

### soundness

 + addition with different steps (todo)

### completeness

+ operation with minuend operands (todo)
